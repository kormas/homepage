# homepage - my first page

## dectription
The homepage body consists of:
- header
- navigation
- main divided on sections
- footer

Currenly there are three sections: 
- "movement of continents" in form of article
- "my favourite music tracks" in form of table
- "task in a loop" which is an example of simple application of JavaScript "switch" statement

The homepage is quite chaotic both in content and visually, but it will be altered in the future.
